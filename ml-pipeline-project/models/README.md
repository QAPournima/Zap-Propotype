# Models Documentation

This directory contains the models used in the machine learning pipeline. Each model is designed to address specific tasks within the project. Below are the key components and usage instructions for the models.

## Model Descriptions

- **Model Name 1**: Brief description of what this model does and its purpose in the pipeline.
- **Model Name 2**: Brief description of what this model does and its purpose in the pipeline.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Training a Model**: 
   - Use the `ModelTrainer` class from `src/model_training.py` to train the models. 
   - Ensure that the data is preprocessed and features are engineered before training.

2. **Evaluating a Model**: 
   - After training, evaluate the model using the functions provided in `src/model_evaluation.py`.
   - Generate reports to understand the model's performance.

3. **Saving and Loading Models**: 
   - Models can be saved using the `save_model` method in the `ModelTrainer` class.
   - Load the models for inference as needed.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that all dependencies are installed as per the `requirements.txt`.
- Refer to the main `README.md` for overall project setup and instructions.
