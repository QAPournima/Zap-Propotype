# Machine Learning Pipeline Project

This project implements a machine learning pipeline that processes raw data, performs exploratory data analysis, trains a model, and evaluates its performance. 

## Project Structure

- **data/**
  - **raw/**: Contains the raw data files used for the machine learning pipeline.
  - **processed/**: Contains the processed data files that have been cleaned and transformed for model training.

- **notebooks/**
  - **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and insights derived from the raw data.

- **src/**
  - **data_preprocessing.py**: Functions for loading and preprocessing the raw data, including methods such as `load_data`, `clean_data`, and `split_data`.
  - **feature_engineering.py**: Functions for feature extraction and transformation, exporting methods like `create_features` and `select_features`.
  - **model_training.py**: Responsible for training the machine learning model, exporting a class `ModelTrainer` with methods `train_model` and `save_model`.
  - **model_evaluation.py**: Functions for evaluating the trained model, exporting methods such as `evaluate_model` and `generate_report`.
  - **utils.py**: Utility functions used across the pipeline, such as `load_config`, `save_results`, and `log_metrics`.

- **models/**
  - **README.md**: Documentation related to the models used in the project, including descriptions and usage instructions.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ml-pipeline-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Prepare the data:
   - Place your raw data files in the `data/raw` directory.

5. Run the exploratory analysis notebook:
   - Open `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb` and execute the cells to analyze the data.

6. Execute the pipeline:
   - Use the scripts in the `src` directory to preprocess data, engineer features, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
